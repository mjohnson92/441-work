# HW-4 Readme for Michael_Johnson

Wow this week was tough, even with my experience with creative coding 120. I'm hoping that things will become more obvious and intuitive
 and no the opposite as we move on through these weeks. The forums were helpful but not quite everything I needed. I was able to find a few resources on the internet. This is quite a difficult class to learn online.
