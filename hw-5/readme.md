# HW-5 Readme for Michael Johnson

This homework wasn't so bad because the directions seemed to be a little more specific this time. It was just easier to follow where to create functions and what methods they had. I remember a little bit of this from creative coding. The ball example in the lesson was a great refresher. I'm still struggling
learning this out of the book. I feel like it is easier to look at the solution or how to solve a problem and work backwards. Sometimes I do the same thing with math if I don't quite understand the direction to go. I hope this will come to me a lot better when it is applied in our html or css. I should make time to practice some similar problems when I have extra time.
