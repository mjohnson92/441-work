# HW-6 Readme for Michael Johnson

This homework wasn't too bad. The hardest part was trying to figure out how to center an image. Checked the issues forum and found that you can use the margin to move it a bit.
The logic of making the website with javscript makes sense to me. I feel a bit more confident now. Obviously I have a lot of questions, but I'm sure we will get there!
I'll tell you one thing I will never mess with the caps in the title of the homework again!!!
