For my final, I found a free template online that I really liked and changed the content to fit the information I wanted to use in a personal portfolio. I removed the pictures and old content from the website and kept the javascript and css. I was really into the flow and style of the webpage so I just wanted to fill it up with my content instead of remaking the wheel.

I added several webpages to the site, one for each project. In the original website it only had 1 project page template so I ended up resuing the template and duplicated it so there would be a uniform look to the project pages. I used all my own personal photos for the website from my computer. It's cool to have all of my favorite creations all in one place.

When I have more time I would like to go in and understand the styling and javascript a bit more. I find it hard for me to believe that I will dive deeper into javascript. I really enjoy doing HTML and CSS though so I may need t get better at javascript if I want to fully utilize those other languages. I understood p5 a bit more than original javascript but they may have been due to schiffman and more content in the 120 class.

It was nice to at least dive in a bit into javascript and see how it works. I hope I do get more comfortable with it but it will require more assignments and reasons for me to use it.

I hope you enjoy my portfolio and the music I create!
