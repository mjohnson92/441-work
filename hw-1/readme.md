# MART 441 - HW - 1

Being the first week of the semester, I would like to note and admit that i procrastinated a bit since I am turning this in at about midnight. I appreciated the style of Michael Musick's example so i took some of that code and reworked it with some of what I remembered from the RWD lesson from Intro to Web Development class. I ended up changing a lot of things and reshaping the page and style to my liking. Looking back at previous code was quite the life saver because it was hard to remember exactly what to do but most of it came back quick after spending a few hours on it. I wanted to put some recent music I've worked on so i used the audio tag but then i realized you were able to save the mp3 by right clicking. So I decided to stream from soundcloud instead.
