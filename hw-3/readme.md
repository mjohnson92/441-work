# HW-3 Readme for MICHAEL_JOHNSON

This week was a bit tough but it was only tough because I've lost a bit of my experience and skills from the creative coding class!
I'll definitely need to keep reviewing some of these videos because even last semester I didn't fully understand what I was achieving. Sometimes I would sit for an hour trying to get loops to work but this basic approach helps me better understand it I think. I think I will definitely need to join a study group! I'm surprised more people aren't looking for help in the issues forum.
