This week wasn't so bad, actually it was a lot easier than I expected. The way javascript is loaded in html makes complete sense
to me. It's very similar to css in the sense that you're loading an external file onto the html document. This way seems like it will
be very useful and keep your code really clean. Excited to move on!
