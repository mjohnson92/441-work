# MART 441 - HW - 7

This week was very challenging. I referenced a lot of code from the website and submissions. It was easier to understand what was kind oe expected of us once I looked at a few other people's submissions. So far the order of things has been the most confusing for me. I find I learn best if I just jump into the code and work backwards, find a way to make it my own, and solve it. I think the most challenging part was trying to make fake pages outside of the secondary pages. On the East side I got all the way to a 4th tab but couldn't figure out how to get past the third on the west side. I don't know, I spent hours on trying to solve this problem but was happy to get past secondary pages. Anyways, it was tough but I do feel like I'm learning through the constant problem solving.
